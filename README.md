# baejosephâ€™s SlowTris

Fully functional Tetris with SRS (Super Rotation System) and Hold and Ghost-view, with a twist:

The pieces fall very slowly (once every 3 minutes) and there are no levels! 

So you are invited to take your time and hard drop at your own pace!
Treat this like a puzzle game of your own making.
It has even got the original music (Please please don't tell Hank)!

## Requirements
**pygame**

## Keyboard Bindings

* Down, Left, Right arrow keys - what you expect
* Up Arrow - Rotate clockwise
* Z / Y keys - Rotate anticlockwise / clockwise
* Spacebar - Hard drop
* Right Shift - Hold

## Still to do
* SRS does not work fully as intended (triple T-spin using wallkicks may not work)
* Have not yet implemented combo scoring / sound effects
* High scores.
