Fully functional Tetris with SRS (Super Rotation System) and Hold and Ghost-view, with a twist:

The pieces fall very slowly (once every 3 minutes) and there are no levels! 

So you are invited to take your time and hard drop at your own pace!
Treat this like a puzzle game of your own making.
It has even got the original GB music (Please don't tell Henk)!

## Requirements

## Keyboard Bindings

* Down, Left, Right arrow keys - what you expect
* Up Arrow - Rotate clockwise
* Z / Y keys - Rotate anticlockwise / clockwise
